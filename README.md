# ComplexFunctionGrapher
A program that will graph a complex function

## Use

To compile this program, make sure to download the tigr.c file off of https://github.com/erkkah/tigr, then place it in the directory along with all of the other files. For running on operating systems that are not windows, you will have to change the build.bat file according to the instructions on the Tigr github page. To change the function you are graphing, you will have to change the contents of the function called function, and then recomile the program and run it. I did not make the function available to be changed at runtime because of performance and development time.
